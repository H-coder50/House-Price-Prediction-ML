# House-Price-Prediction-ML
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict House Sales Price. It is Regression ML. 

We are going to perform a complete machine learning process on the House Price dataset.

Steps:

1- Load the data

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3- Handle missing values

4- Handle inconsistencies

5- Check distributions 

	(Apply log method for Normalize data)
  
6- Data Preprocessing (encoding)

7- Correlation Analysis

8- Model Train & Test Split

9- Apply Regression Model

	* Random Forest Regressor
  
	* Decision Tree Regressor
  
	* Gradient Boosting 
  
	* Linear Regression
  
	* Support Vector Regressor
  
10- Apply Matrices

	* Mean Squared Error
  
	* Mean Absolute Error
  
	* Root Mean Squared Error
  
	* R-squared
  
11- Conclusion
